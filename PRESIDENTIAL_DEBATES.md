|**1980**| **Ronald Reagan** v Jimmy Carter and John Anderson | Before debates, Reagan polled at 38%, Carter polled at 37%, and Anderson polled at 17%. According to Gallup, Anderson pulled Carter down by 8%, and Reagan down by 1%. So Carter wanted Anderson out, and Reagan wanted Anderson in.

|Oct 28 | [YT: ReaganFoundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8YxFc_1b_0) | Reagan and Carter without Anderson.  CNN aired a special version which attempted to make it seem like Anderson was there by having him respond to taped versions of Reagan and Carter ([AP Archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTK-2W11Vh1V4uwofOfR4w/search?query=carter+reagan+anderson)).  The official debate was viewed by 80.6 million ([nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2008/top-ten-presidential-debates-1960-to-present/)), and CNN was only available in 3 million homes at the time ([Christian Science Monitor](https://www.csmonitor.com/1980/1027/102722.html)), not sure how many of them tuned in. |

|**1988**| **George H.W. Bush** v Michael Dukakis  | Until now, the debates were organized by the League of Women Voters.  In 1988 the two parties agreed on rules in secret, so LWV pulled out, and the two parties formed the Commission on Presidential Debates, which ran this and future debates.
